<h1>The best movie according to Deepak</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>
    This is my most favourite movie of all. It has everything from great writing, dailogures, <br/>
    background music, vfx, great characters...everything
</p>
<h3>Avengers: Infinity war</h3>
<p>The best movie among the superhero genre. In most of the movies, Hero ends beating <br> 
    the villain, but in this one, we are really not sure what will happens</p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>Best movie among the non-fiction category</p>
